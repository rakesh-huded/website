        <p>The students who are interested in placement are informed to register in the Training and Placement Office (TPO) at the end of VI semester. The students are categorised under below 60, 60+, 65+ and 70+ based on their academic performance in 10th, 12th and Engineering (upto VI semester). They are further categorized under IT and non-IT related domains.</p>

        <p>  The TPO approaches the companies either in person or through mail along with the details of the students performance and invites them for the campus drive.</p>
   
        <p>  One student coordinator recommended by Head of the Department/Department faculty coordinator is appointed from each department. A whatsapp group is created consisting of office bearers of TPO and department faculty and student coordinators. The student coordinators of the department in turn have a whatsapp group of all the students of their department. All the messages from the TPO are sent in the whatsapp group to the student coordinator, who in turn forwards it to the student of department group.</p>
   
        <p> The details of the company visiting the campus along with the eligibility criteria is sent in the whatsapp group. The interested students are informed to register their names with the TPO for the drive. On the day of drive the students attend the pre-placement talk, written/online test, Group discussion, technical and personal interview. The company officials are requested to announce the short listed students names on the day of the interview as the college follows the policy of one student one job on campus.</p>
   
        <p> An employability test by Aspiring Minds - AMCAT is conducted every year for interested students. The students are tested in English language, Aptitude, Programming Skills, Domain knowledge etc. The test scores along with their strength and weakness is sent to the students. The test scores are also shared by Aspiring Minds with the companies. The companies shortlist the students and send interview letters to the students mail. Interested students attend the interview and get selected for the job.</p>
   
        <p>  Awareness of Career opportunities in various fields is given to the students through Seminars and invited talks by experts. Students are also made aware of opportunities in higher education in India and abroad.</p>
